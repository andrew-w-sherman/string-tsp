# Grid Model 1

A simple grid model that uses the darkness of the squares in between the nails to create the image. It only allows the string to make knight moves and one-square bishop moves.

note: darkness vals out of 10

##variables

edge existence (n*m*12) (roughly)

degree multiplier constraints (integer >0, could be >1 to get rid of angle issue) (could also allow for = 0)

##constraints

even degree constraints

subtour elimination, maybe?
